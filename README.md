# chess
 Cute first project: chess
 
	This game is my first project, which i've made in 7 days, after my first YouTube SFMl course from Suraj Sharma, and after C++ course from BroCode.

	This game variation is lacking checks for squares, on which an enemy can move, therefore there is no check, mate or castling restriction.

	Also, there is a bug, when you are trying to move a piece, it moves in a square where you cannot move it. The bug is just visual.

	Features to add:
	-ai, specifically stockfish
	-timer
	-choosing of side
	-choosing of two players/vs ai
	
	Features, not really comperetable with my game logic:
	-check for squares, on which an enemy can move
	-check for draw
